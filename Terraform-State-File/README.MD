Terraform Update: Say Goodbye to DynamoDB for State Locking! 🎉

Great news for Terraform users! The latest Terraform release now supports S3 native state locking, eliminating the need for DynamoDB-based state locking. That means:

✅ Simplified backend configuration
✅ Reduced resource dependencies
✅ Easier state management

🔄 What’s Changing?
Previously, Terraform required a DynamoDB table to manage state locking in S3 backends, ensuring that multiple users didn’t override the same state file. With S3 native locking, Terraform now handles this natively, making the setup cleaner and more efficient!

🛠️ How to Migrate?
Updating your configuration is straightforward!
🔹 Old Configuration (Using DynamoDB for Locking):

terraform {
 backend "s3" {
 bucket = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
 key = "path/to/your/statefile.tfstate"
 region = "us-east-1"
 dynamodb_table = "your-dynamodb-lock-table" # Required earlier
 encrypt = true
 }
}

🔹 New Configuration (With S3 Native Locking):

terraform {
 backend "s3" {
 bucket = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
 key = "path/to/your/statefile.tfstate"
 region = "us-east-1"
 encrypt = true
 use_lockfile = true # New S3 native locking!
 }
}

⚡ Why Should You Upgrade?
🔹 Easier Maintenance – No more DynamoDB tables to manage
🔹 Cost Optimization – Reduce AWS costs by eliminating unnecessary resources
🔹 Improved Performance – Faster state locking and unlocking
🔹 Future-Proof – DynamoDB locking will soon be deprecated, so start migrating now!
